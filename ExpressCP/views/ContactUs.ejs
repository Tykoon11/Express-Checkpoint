      <p>
        I'm generally confused most of the time. Pretend. You pretend the
        feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows?
        Maybe one day they will be. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I
        know you hate funerals. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the
        years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.
